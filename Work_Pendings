Upadate the Handling the Transactions and Processing the OCPP Data.


// When ever new transaction starts, last transaction details in the table meter stop and reason were changed.
// one more thing is when ever the new transactions occurs the ew transaction is placed according the number priority of the trnasaction id. But it should display like all the transactions should come one by one. 

1. Energy Meter calculation after the Stop Transaction. MeterStop is updating live but after the stop transaction the value is added correctely.
2. after the new transaction the prvious details of meter stop and reason are missing.

3. Ws, Serial, Timer need to execute.
4. Serial Monitor, need to detlete Auto-Scroll. and execute the auto scrollling like JSON Data Separator.
5. Need to execute the flashing the firmware.
6. Need to connect to the device get the characerterstics. pass wifi credentials and websocket link.
7. need to execute kcpp flow.
8. KCPP modification.
9. Need to implement Application type both windows and mobile
10. need to merge the automation APP & Serial APP together and create need application.
11. Need to create multiple Serial data readings in the Windows applications. 

New Application targets.
- KCPP Flow Automation: 
    i. mqtt connection
    ii. Subscribe to the topic
    iii. publish to the topic.
    iv. Write the Test Cases.
    v. execute the automation scripts.
    vi. Create  the test case full, optional, divisional executions.
    vii. Generate the Reports for the executed Test Cases.

-- OCPP Flow.
    i. Need to understand.

    ii. Execute the multiple serial Data Reading.
